# RCAICT 2025 Submission Guidelines: Comprehensive Instructions and Rules for Authors

## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive guide to the submission requirements for the RCAICT 2025 conference, hosted by the Faculty of Technological Studies. Its primary objective is to consolidate all essential instructions and rules, ensuring prospective authors possess a clear, precise, and actionable reference for preparing and submitting their Abstract and Extended Abstract. Adherence to these guidelines is not merely a suggestion but a critical prerequisite for successful submission and consideration within the academic review process.

> The source material explicitly outlines "detailed instructions and rules for authors submitting to the Faculty of Technological Studies". This explicit statement conveys a significant expectation of compliance from the conference organizers. In academic and research contexts, the presence of such detailed guidelines typically indicates that strict adherence to every specified detail, from formatting to content, is anticipated. Any deviation can signal a lack of attention to detail or an incomplete understanding of academic publishing standards, which may lead to submissions being excluded from the review process. Therefore, meticulous conformity to these requirements is fundamental for a submission to even be considered for peer review, directly influencing its prospects for acceptance.

## 2. Key Submission Deadlines

Authors must be acutely aware of the submission deadline to ensure their work is considered for RCAICT 2025. Missing this deadline will result in the automatic disqualification of the submission, irrespective of its quality or potential contribution.

The initial submission deadline was July 15th, 2025, which has been formally extended to **July 31st, 2025**. This extended date represents the absolute final opportunity for submission. While an extension provides additional time for authors to refine their work, it is important to understand that in academic conference contexts, an "extended" deadline is almost universally the final, non-negotiable cutoff. Conference organizers typically do not offer further extensions after an initial one, primarily because doing so complicates the intricate review schedules and subsequent publication timelines. Consequently, authors should treat July 31st, 2025, as a strict cut-off point, making every effort to submit well in advance to mitigate risks associated with last-minute technical issues or unforeseen circumstances.

## 3. Required Submission Documents

Authors are mandated to submit two distinct files for their contribution to RCAICT 2025. These are separate documents, each with its own specific requirements and purpose within the submission workflow.

Authors must prepare and submit two separate files: an **Abstract** and an **Extended Abstract**. The requirement for two distinct documents suggests a multi-stage review process or different functional roles for each document within the conference proceedings. For example, the concise Abstract might be utilized for initial screening or inclusion in a brief program booklet, while the more comprehensive Extended Abstract serves as the primary document for detailed peer review. It is also possible that the Abstract is intended for earlier public dissemination, whereas the Extended Abstract undergoes a more rigorous review for a more substantial publication, such as conference proceedings. Authors must ensure consistency between these two documents, particularly regarding the core message and findings, while also tailoring each to its specific length and content requirements. Submitting only one document, or incorrectly combining them, will lead to an incomplete submission and is likely to result in rejection.

## 4. General Submission Procedures

Beyond the content itself, the method and format of submission are critical for proper processing and successful entry into the review pipeline.

All submissions, encompassing both the Abstract and Extended Abstract, must be sent via email to `rcaict2025@vau.ac.lk`. This designated email address is the sole channel for submission.

Regarding acceptable file formats, specific distinctions apply to each document:

*   The **Abstract** must be submitted exclusively in `.docx` or `.doc` format. No other file types are permitted for the Abstract.
*   The **Extended Abstract** offers more flexibility, allowing submission in either `.docx` / `.doc` or `PDF` format.

The differing file format requirements for the Abstract (only Word) versus the Extended Abstract (Word or PDF) suggest varying processing needs or stages. The strict Word format for the Abstract may imply that organizers intend to perform direct editing or compilation, perhaps for a program booklet or an online abstract collection, where a Word document is more amenable to layout adjustments. Conversely, the flexibility for the Extended Abstract to be submitted as a PDF suggests it might be primarily intended for direct review and publication without significant layout alterations by the organizers, or that PDF is preferred for preserving the author's precise formatting during the review process. Authors opting for PDF for their Extended Abstract must ensure that their PDF conversion is flawless, as any formatting errors introduced during this process will be their responsibility. For Word documents, authors should ensure compatibility across different Word versions. Submitting an Abstract in PDF format, or an Extended Abstract in an unsupported format, will lead to an invalid submission and is likely to result in rejection or a request for re-submission, consuming valuable time.

## 5. Detailed Abstract Guidelines

The Abstract serves as a concise summary of the work and must adhere to strict content and formatting specifications. Its purpose is to provide a quick overview of the research, allowing reviewers and readers to grasp the essence of the submission rapidly.

### 5.1 Content Requirements for the Abstract

*   **Title**: The title must not exceed 100 characters, including spaces. This is a precise character limit, not a word count. It should be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 14 pt, and **Bold**.
*   **Abstract Body**: The main text of the abstract is limited to a maximum of 250 words. A critical rule for the abstract body is that **no citations are allowed** within this section. This emphasizes that the abstract should be a self-contained summary of the author's own work, findings, and conclusions, without relying on external validation or context provided by references. It is meant to stand alone as a brief overview of the research presented. The abstract body should be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing. A crucial rule explicitly states that abstracts exceeding the maximum limit will be returned. This indicates a rigorous pre-screening process for compliance, potentially automated, to filter out non-compliant submissions before any content review begins. This saves reviewers' time and underscores the importance of adhering to the specified limits. Authors must account for potential delays if their abstract is returned for exceeding limits, as this could jeopardize their ability to meet the final deadline if not rectified promptly.
*   **Keywords**: A maximum of 5 keywords must be provided. These should be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 11 pt, and *Italic*.

### 5.2 Formatting Rules for the Abstract

Authors must follow the given format in the template for the abstract. This implies that a specific template is either provided or implicitly expected, guiding the overall layout beyond the individual element specifications.

To facilitate compliance, the following table summarizes the formatting requirements for the Abstract:

**Table 1: Abstract Formatting Quick Reference**

| Element | Requirement | Font Size | Style | Line Spacing | Other Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | Max 100 characters | *Times New Roman* 14 pt | **Bold** | N/A | |
| **Abstract Body** | Max 250 words | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | No citations allowed; exceeding limit will be returned |
| **Keywords** | Max 5 keywords | *Times New Roman* 11 pt | *Italic* | N/A | Must follow template |

## 6. Detailed Extended Abstract Guidelines

The Extended Abstract provides a more comprehensive overview of the research and has its own distinct structural and formatting requirements, allowing for a deeper presentation of the work.

The Extended Abstract is limited to a maximum of **four (04) pages**, and it must be presented in a **single-column format**. The specification of a "single column" is a crucial layout instruction. Many academic conference templates often default to a two-column format; therefore, authors must actively ensure their document adheres to this single-column requirement, potentially by overriding template defaults or configuring their document settings from scratch. Failure to comply with this layout instruction could render the document difficult for reviewers to read or for organizers to process, indicating non-compliance with basic presentation rules.

### 6.1 Required Sections and Formatting for the Extended Abstract

The Extended Abstract must include specific sections, each with defined formatting:

*   **Title**: The title should be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 14 pt, and **Bold**.
*   **Abstract**: This section should be included within the Extended Abstract. While no specific formatting details are provided for this particular abstract section within the Extended Abstract, it is generally understood that it should follow the general body text formatting (*Times New Roman*, 12 pt, 1.5 line spacing) unless explicitly specified otherwise by a template.
*   **Introduction**: This section must be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing.
*   **Materials & Methods**: This section must be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing.
*   **Results and Discussion**: This section must be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing.
*   **Conclusions**: This section should be included "as applicable" , indicating it might be optional depending on the nature of the research, though it is generally expected in academic papers. It must be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing.
*   **References**: References must adhere to the **Harvard citation style**. This is a precise instruction that demands specific knowledge of the Harvard referencing system or the use of reference management tools configured for this style. Authors must be familiar with its nuances for both in-text citations and the reference list entries (e.g., author-date system) to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout their paper. Incorrect referencing can be a significant concern for reviewers, potentially indicating a lack of academic rigor. References should be formatted in *Times New Roman*, 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing.

To aid authors in formatting their Extended Abstract, the following table provides a detailed summary of the requirements for each section:

**Table 2: Extended Abstract Section Formatting Details**

| Section | Font Size | Style | Line Spacing | Other Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | *Times New Roman* 14 pt | **Bold** | N/A | |
| **Abstract (within EA)** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | Follows general body text formatting |
| **Introduction** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | |
| **Materials & Methods** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | |
| **Results and Discussion** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | |
| **Conclusions** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | As applicable |
| **References** | *Times New Roman* 12 pt | Normal | 1.5 | Harvard citation style; Max 4 pages, Single column |

## 7. Crucial General Submission Rules

Beyond document-specific guidelines, overarching rules apply to both submissions and are paramount for maintaining the integrity and fairness of the review process.

A critical instruction is that **author details should not be included in either the abstract or the extended abstract**. This explicit exclusion of author details strongly indicates that RCAICT 2025 employs a **double-blind peer review process**. In such a system, both the authors' and reviewers' identities are concealed to ensure impartiality and prevent bias in the evaluation of submissions.

For authors, this means going beyond simply removing names and affiliations from the title page. They must meticulously anonymize their submissions. This includes checking document properties (metadata) for any identifying information that might be embedded automatically by word processing software. Furthermore, authors must exercise caution with self-citations that could inadvertently reveal their identity (e.g., "In our previous work..."). If self-citations are necessary, they should be phrased neutrally or anonymized (e.g., "[Anonymous, 2023]"). Failure to properly anonymize the submission is a severe breach of academic integrity protocols for double-blind review and will almost certainly lead to immediate desk rejection without review, regardless of the quality of the research presented.

## 8. Conclusion

Successful submission to RCAICT 2025 hinges on meticulous adherence to the detailed instructions and rules outlined in this report. Authors must pay close attention to deadlines, file formats, and the specific content and formatting requirements for both the Abstract and Extended Abstract. Crucially, strict anonymity must be maintained in all submitted documents to ensure a fair and unbiased review process. By diligently following these guidelines, authors can significantly enhance their chances of successful submission and consideration for the conference.
